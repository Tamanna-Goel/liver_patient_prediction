ðŸš€ Liver Patient Prediction

ðŸ”§ Tools: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
ðŸ§  Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
ðŸŽ¯ Accuracy: 75%

This healthcare-focused project aims to predict the likelihood of liver disease based on key biological markers such as bilirubin levels, enzyme readings, and patient demographics. After preprocessing and EDA, multiple classification models were tested, with Decision Trees performing best. Visualizations revealed critical trends in liver-related conditions.
