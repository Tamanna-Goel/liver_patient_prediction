This healthcare-focused project aims to predict the likelihood of liver disease based on key biological markers such as bilirubin levels, enzyme readings, and patient demographics. After preprocessing and EDA, multiple classification models were tested, with Decision Trees performing best. Visualizations revealed critical trends in liver-related conditions. This project successfully predicted liver function anomalies using machine learning models, providing valuable insights into factors affecting liver health. By analysing the dataset with key features such as bilirubin levels, liver enzymes, and protein ratios, we identified critical biomarkers that significantly influence liver function. The data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and removing outliers, helped prepare the dataset for modelling. Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, were tested. Among these, the Gradient Boosting model emerged as the best-performing model, delivering the highest F1-Score and recall, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict liver anomalies. While challenges such as missing values and model performance issues were encountered, they were addressed using strategies like imputation, outlier removal, and hyperparameter tuning. In conclusion, this project highlights the importance of specific biomarkers in diagnosing liver anomalies and underscores the potential of machine learning models in predicting liver dysfunction, offering a path toward more efficient and early diagnosis. Future work could explore deep learning models or additional clinical features to further improve accuracy.
